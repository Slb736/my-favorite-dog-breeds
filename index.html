	<h4 class="h4d">Breed: Doberman Pinscher</h4>
	<h4 class="h4dd">Description:</h4>
	<p> Doberman Pinschers are one of my favorite dog breeds because I think they look really cool, and I love their posture and pointy ears.</p>

	<h4 class="h4pd">Description:</h4>
	<p class="h4pp"> Pitbulls are one of my favorite dog breeds because I've had several, and, when trained well, they are very loyal and loving.</p>

	<h4 class="h4ld">Description:</h4>
	<p> Labradors are one of my favorite dog breeds because, like pitbulls, I've had multiple, and they are very well-behaved and easily trained compared to many other dog breeds.</p>
